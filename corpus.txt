Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure typically does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia.

Hypertension is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension. About 90–95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, and alcohol use. The remaining 5–10% of cases are categorized as secondary high blood pressure, defined as high blood pressure due to an identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of certain medications.

For most adults, a healthy blood pressure is usually less than 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure between 120/80 mmHg and 130/89 mmHg is considered elevated. High blood pressure (hypertension) is defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher.

Lifestyle changes and medications are the primary treatments for high blood pressure. Lifestyle changes include weight loss, physical exercise, decreased salt intake, reducing alcohol intake, and a healthy diet. If lifestyle changes are not sufficient then blood pressure medications are used. Up to three medications can control blood pressure in 90% of people. The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure (defined as >160/100 mmHg) with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy.

It is important to regularly monitor your blood pressure, especially if you have risk factors for hypertension. Home blood pressure monitoring can be a useful tool in managing high blood pressure. It is also important to take your medications as prescribed by your doctor and to follow up with your doctor regularly.

Some people with very high blood pressure (e.g., systolic pressure >180 or diastolic pressure >110), may experience symptoms such as headaches, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), altered vision or fainting spells. These symptoms are often referred to as a hypertensive crisis. If you experience these symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention.

A healthy diet is crucial for managing hypertension. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is often recommended. This diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, nuts, and beans, and is limited in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, red meat, and added fats.

Regular physical activity can help lower your blood pressure. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a week, or a combination of both. Examples of moderate-intensity activities include brisk walking, swimming, and cycling. Vigorous-intensity activities include running, jumping rope, and hiking uphill.

Losing weight if you are overweight or obese can significantly lower your blood pressure. Even a small amount of weight loss can make a difference.

Reducing your sodium intake can also help lower your blood pressure. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 2,300 milligrams (mg) a day and an ideal limit of no more than 1,500 mg per day for most adults.

Limiting alcohol can also help. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women should have no more than one drink per day.

If you smoke, quitting is one of the best things you can do for your overall health, including your blood pressure.
